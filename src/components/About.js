                My curiosity for web development began in 2015 when I launched my e-commerce business, <strong><a id="link" href="https://FairSeasSupplyCo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fair Seas Supply Co.</a></strong>, where I sell organic Turkish towels. I designed the brand and built my website on Shopify. As a solopreneur I wear many hats which also include managing all social channels, email campaigns and product developmentfor the brand.</p>
